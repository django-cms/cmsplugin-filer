To get started using ``cmsplugin-filer``:

    $ pip install cmsplugin-filer

- configure ``django-filer`` as documented in http://django-filer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html#configuration

- add the plugins to ``INSTALLED_APPS``::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'cmsplugin_filer_file',
        'cmsplugin_filer_folder',
        'cmsplugin_filer_image',
        'cmsplugin_filer_teaser',
        'cmsplugin_filer_video',
        ...
    )
    
- run ``syncdb`` or ``migrate`` if you're using South.

You can also set ``FILER_IMAGE_USE_ICON`` in your ``settings.py`` to configure ``cmsplugin_filer_image`` plugin to use 32x32 icons for representing plugin instances.

The default template in ``cmsplugin_filer_image`` expects the subject location functionality to be enabled.

Upgrading
=========

Please note that current develop version moved plugin packages from `src` directory to project root.
This may break your installation if upgrading.
Uninstall any previous `cmsplugin_filer` installation (either from Pypi or from github repository) and reinstall it.


Integrations

---------------------------

``cmsplugin_filer_image`` provides integration with
`djangocms-text-ckeditor <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangocms-text-ckeditor/>`__.
